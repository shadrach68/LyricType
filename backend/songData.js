      "She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene. I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one? She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round. She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene. Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one. People always told me be careful of what you do, and don't go around breaking young girls' hearts. And mother always told me be careful of who you love. And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth. Billie Jean is not my lover. She's just a girl who claims that I am the one. But the kid is not my son.",

You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it. You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes, you're paralyzed. 'Cause this is thriller, thriller night. And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike. You know it's thriller, thriller night. You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight. Darkness falls across the land. The midnight hour is close at hand. Creatures crawl in search of blood. To terrorize y'all's neighborhood.",

If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and then make a change. I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love. It's time that I realize that there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan. Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone? A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart, and a washed-out dream. They follow the pattern of the wind you see. 'Cause they got no place to be. That's why I'm starting with me.",

And in your eyes, you're holding mine. Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms. Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song. When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath. But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight. Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know.

I got nothing left to lose, or use, or do. My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space. And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say.

Maybe just the touch of a hand. Oh me, I fall in love with you every single day. And I just wanna tell you I am. So honey now. Take me into your loving arms.

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun. But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time. Goodbye Papa, please pray for me. I was the black sheep of the family.
